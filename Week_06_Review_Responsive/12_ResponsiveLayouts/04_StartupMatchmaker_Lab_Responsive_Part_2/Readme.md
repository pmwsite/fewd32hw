#FEWD Week #6: Startup Matchmaker Part 2


---


###Exercise Problem 
The goal of this exercise is to build the navigation and footer for the Startup Matchmaker website. The header and footer must both be responsive.

#### Header
* Create a navigation in the header. (see content below)
    * give the links a padding of 8px on the top and bottom, and 12px on either side.
    * on hover show a 2px solid yellow line without any other layout change visible
    * Shrink the logo text to 20px
* Make the header responsive. Suggested breakpoint is 840px;
* Add a 'hamburger icon' with a width of 30px. It should only show for the mobile display.
* Use jQuery to show the navigation upon click. Hint: toggleClass() will be very useful here.

#### Footer
* Create a footer of four columns using the content below
* Links on hover should have a yellow background and black text
* The footer should be responsive and go to two columns then one column
